# Description of your program (part 7)
Create an integer variable with an initial value of 0, which records the number of words in the document.
There are two ways of writing the main program:
The first one is under the assumption of there are no two or more consecutive spaces in the document.
Create an iterator which iterates over each character in the document.
Start to iterate from the first character of the document.
During iteration, every time when the character it checks equals to the space character, adds 1 to the integer variable.

The second one is under the assumption of there are possibly two or more consecutive spaces in the document.
Create a linked list, iterates over each character in the document and store each one into the linked list.
Start to iterate from the first character of the document.
During iteration, every time when the value of node it checks equals to the space character, and the value of next node does not equal to the space character, adds 1 to the integer variable.

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
The previous experience was a little bit difficult for me. While trying to describe the instructions in English, there are a lot of grey areas which I was not clear about, for example:
When talking about numbers, do we present it in a numerical way or a letter way?

While writing the instruction, I struggled to maintain the balance of being easy to understood and being technical and detailed enough. I also had to write two approaches of writing the programs based on different assumptions on the document's content, which is something I was not sure if I should do or not.

In terms of coding experience, I took CSE 142, 143, 373, INFO 201 as well as finishing a coding camp on web development and Ruby, so I had a lot of exposure and experience in MVC and web development. My main goal for the course is to have a stronger foundation in coding. I had very little experience with Python before (i.e. went through the syntax and stuff), so I hope I could explore the world of data analysis and software dev more through the lens of Python :)
